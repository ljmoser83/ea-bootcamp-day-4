    "## Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific data can come in a variety of file formats and types. In this course, you will work with data stored in plain text files (.txt) and comma-delimited text files (.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain Text Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Plain text files simply list out the values on separate lines without any symbols or delimiters to indicate separate values. For example, data for the average monthly precipitation data for Boulder, CO can be stored as a plain text file (.txt), with a separate line for each month's value. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "0.70\n",
    "0.75\n",
    "1.85\n",
    "2.93\n",
    "3.05\n",
    "2.02\n",
    "1.93\n",
    "1.62\n",
    "1.84\n",
    "1.31\n",
    "1.39\n",
    "0.84\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to their simplicity, text files (.txt) can be very useful for collecting very large datasets that are all the same type of observation or data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike plain-text files which simply list out the values on separate lines without any symbols or delimiters, comma delimited (CSV) files use commas (or some other delimiter like tab spaces or semi-colons) to indicate separate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that CSV files can easily support multiple rows and columns of related data. For example, data for the monthly precipitation for Boulder, CO for the years 2002 and 2013 can be stored together in a comma delimited (.csv) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1.07, 0.44, 1.50, 0.20, 3.20, 1.18, 0.09, 1.44, 1.52, 2.44, 0.78, 0.02\n",
    "0.27, 1.13, 1.72, 4.14, 2.66, 0.61, 1.03, 1.40, 18.16, 2.24, 0.29, 0.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson and the next lesson, you will use data from:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a .txt file containing the average monthly precipitation data for Boulder, CO\n",
