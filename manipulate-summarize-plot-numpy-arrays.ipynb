    "##  Indexing For Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lessons on lists, you learned that `Python` indexing begins with `[0]`, and that you can use indexing to query the value of items within `Python` lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access elements (i.e. values) in `numpy arrays` using indexing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-dimensional Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "For one-dimensional `numpy arrays`, you only need to specific one index value to access the elements in the `numpy array` (e.g.  `arrayname[index,]`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The example below is an one-dimensional array that has 3 elements, or values. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "avg_monthly_precip = numpy.array([0.70, 0.75, 1.85])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `avg_monthly_precip[2,]` to get the third element in (`1.85`) from this one-dimensional `numpy array`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that you are using use the index `[2]` for the third place because `Python` indexing begins with `[0]`, not with `[1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-dimensional Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "With two-dimensional arrays, you need to specify to both a row index and a column index. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example below is an two-dimensional array with 2 rows and 3 columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "precip_2002_2013 = numpy.array([[1.07, 0.44, 1.5],\n",
    "                              [0.27, 1.13, 1.72]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `precip_2002_2013[1, 2]` to get the element in the second row, third column (`1.72`) of this two-dimensional `numpy array`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you saw for the one-dimensional `numpy array`, you use the index `[1,2]` for the second row and third column because `Python` indexing begins with `[0]`, not with `[1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will use indexing to select elements within one-dimensional and two-dimensional `numpy arrays`, and you will learn how to manipulate, summarize, and plot these `numpy arrays`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the same datasets from the previous lesson on importing text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a .txt file containing the average monthly precipitation data for Boulder, CO\n",
    "* a .csv file containing the monthly precipitation for Boulder, CO for the years 2002 and 2013\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Begin Writing Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Import Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous lesson, you have already learned how to import the necessary packages to set the working directory and download the needed datasets using the `os` and `urllib` packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with `numpy arrays`, you will also need to import the `numpy` package with the alias `np`, and you will need to import the `matplotlib.pyplot` module with the alias `plt` to plot data. Begin by reviewing these tasks."
